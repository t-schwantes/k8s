# The way I have it set up right now requires passwordless ssh and sudo for remote node setup

# Passwordless ssh 
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
ssh-copy-id default@192.168.0.101

sudo visudo # probe need a better way, this just makes no password for sudo
# %sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
%sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL




# Also need to set up passwordless ssh onto synology and passwordless sudo

I had to check a box, go to control panel -> user & group -> advanced at the bottom click enable user home service
copy over ssh key 
edit /etc/sudoers.d to have passwordless sudo
